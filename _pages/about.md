This webpage is powered by the [academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) template and hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com). This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV.
